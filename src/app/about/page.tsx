                        Hello! I'm Loc Nguyen, and my passion for programming
                        has been with me since my early years. Although I
                        attended IT universities, the broad curriculum didn't
                        quite align with my main interest â€“ coding. Determined
                        to pursue my passion, I took the self-taught route,
                        starting with YouTube tutorials. Web development
                        captured my heart, and I dove into building websites
                        independently.

                    <p data-fade="4">
                        As coding became second nature, I decided to broaden my
                        skills. I enrolled in a university program focused on
                        web design called{" "}

                        </CustomLink>
                        . Here, I not only delved deeper into coding but also
                        recognized the significance of soft skills like
                        communication, time management, and teamwork. I continue
                        to refine these skills daily, understanding their
                        crucial role in a developer's success.

                        With 5 years of experience as a web developer

                        especially Laravel spans 2 years, I've dedicated each
                        day within that timeframe to backend programming. I'm
                        also keen on expanding my knowledge in DevOps and cloud
