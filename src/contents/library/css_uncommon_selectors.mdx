> CSS: Some CSS Selectors You Should Know

I have been using CSS for a while now, and I have come across some CSS selectors that I myself haven't heard and seen before despite using CSS for more than 7 years now. Here are some of them:

## Empty Selectors
The `:empty` selector is used to select elements that contain no children. For example, the following CSS will hide any empty `div` elements:
```html
<div class="container">
    <p>This paragraph is not empty.</p>
    <span></span>
    <div></div>
</div>
``` 
```css
.container div:empty {
    display: none;
}
```

## Target Selectors
The `:target` selector matches the current active hashtag in the URL. For example, the following CSS will change the background color of the element with the ID of `#about` when the URL contains `#about`:
```html
<div id="about">
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>This is the about section.</p>
</div>
```
```css
#about:target {
    background-color: yellow;
}
```

## Lang Selectors
The `:lang` selector is used to select elements with a specific language. For example, the following CSS will change the color of any element with the `lang` attribute set to `fr`:
```html
<p lang="fr">Bonjour!</p>
<p lang="en">Hello!</p>
```

```css
p:lang(fr) {
    color: blue;
}

p:lang(en) {
    color: green;
}
```
