> Laravel: Inertia.js, React and Typescript setup

In order to make Laravel work with Inertia, React and Typescript, you need to install a few packages. This is a great starting point for a new project, if you don't feel like using Laravel Breeze.

The reason why you may not want to use Laravel Breeze is because it comes with a lot of extra stuff that you may not need.

So if you are interested in a more minimal setup, then this is the way to go. Typescript is of course optional, but it's a great way to make your code more robust. Otherwise, you can just leave the typescript part out.

## Install the npm packages
```bash
npm install @vitejs/plugin-react @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @inertiajs/react react react-dom typescript --save-dev
```
## Install the composer packages
```bash
composer require inertiajs/inertia-laravel tightenco/ziggy
```
## Entry point for Inertia and Vite
Below is the entry point for Inertia and Vite. This is the file that will be used to render the Inertia pages. The file name is `app.blade.php` and it should be placed in the `resources/views` directory.

The Laravel Inertia adapter will look the root template named `app.blade.php` by default and use it to render the Inertia pages. If you would like to use a different root view, you can change that using the `Inertia::setRootView` method.
```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="{{ str_replace('_', '-', app()->getLocale()) }}">

<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

    <title inertia>{{ config('app.name', 'Laravel') }}</title>

    <!-- Fonts -->
    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.bunny.net">
    <link href="https://fonts.bunny.net/css?family=figtree:400,500,600&display=swap" rel="stylesheet" />

    <!-- Scripts -->
    @routes
    @viteReactRefresh
    @vite(['resources/js/app.tsx', "resources/js/Pages/{$page['component']}.tsx"])
    @inertiaHead
</head>

<body class="font-sans antialiased">
    @inertia
</body>

</html>
```

## Setup Inertia Middleware
Inertia middleware is used to share data with the client. You can generate a new middleware using the following command:
```bash
php artisan inertia:middleware
```
This will create a new middleware in the `App\Http\Middleware` directory. In order to use the middleware (`HandleInertiaRequests`), you need to add it to the `web` middleware group in the `app/Http/Kernel.php` file.

```php
protected $middlewareGroups = [
    'web' => [
        // ...
        \App\Http\Middleware\HandleInertiaRequests::class,
    ],
    // ...
];
```

## Setup Vite
### Typscript config (optional)
This is optional, but highly recommended. If you want to use typescript, you need to create a `tsconfig.json` file in the root of your project. Below is the configurations you need.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
      "allowJs": true,
      "module": "ESNext",
      "moduleResolution": "bundler",
      "jsx": "react-jsx",
      "strict": true,
      "isolatedModules": true,
      "target": "ESNext",
      "esModuleInterop": true,
      "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
      "noEmit": true,
      "paths": {
          "@/*": ["./resources/js/*"],
          "ziggy-js": ["./vendor/tightenco/ziggy"]
      }
  },
  "include": ["resources/js/**/*.ts", "resources/js/**/*.tsx", "resources/js/**/*.d.ts"]
}
```

### Vite config
Create a `vite.config.ts` file in the root of your project. Below is the configurations you need. This is the base setup for a Vite project.

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from "vite"
import laravel from "laravel-vite-plugin"
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react"

export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
        laravel({
            input: "resources/js/app.tsx",
            refresh: true,
        }),
        react(),
    ],
});
```

## Setup React
### App component
Create a new file called `app.tsx` in the `resources/js` directory. This is the entry point for the React application.

```tsx
import "./bootstrap";
import "../css/app.css";

import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import { createInertiaApp } from "@inertiajs/react";
import { resolvePageComponent } from "laravel-vite-plugin/inertia-helpers";

const appName = import.meta.env.VITE_APP_NAME || "Laravel";

createInertiaApp({
    title: (title) => `${title} - ${appName}`,
    resolve: (name) =>
        resolvePageComponent(
            `./Pages/${name}.tsx`,
            import.meta.glob("./Pages/**/*.tsx")
        ),
    setup({ el, App, props }) {
        const root = createRoot(el);

        root.render(<App {...props} />);
    },
    progress: {
        color: "#4B5563",
    },
});
```

## Optional: Typescript setup
If you are using typescript there are a few files you need to create.
### `global.d.ts`
This file is used to declare global types. Create a new file called `global.d.ts` in the `resources/js/types` directory.

```typescript
import { AxiosInstance } from "axios"
import ziggyRoute from "ziggy-js"

declare global {
    interface Window {
        axios: AxiosInstance;
    }

    var route: typeof ziggyRoute;
}
```
### `index.d.ts`
This file is used to declare project specific types. Create a new file called `index.d.ts` in the `resources/js/types` directory.

```typescript
export interface BaseRecord {
    id?: number
    created_at?: string
    updated_at?: string
}

export interface User extends BaseRecord {
    name: string
    email: string
    email_verified_at: string
}

export type PageProps<
    T extends Record<string, unknown> = Record<string, unknown>
> = T & {
    auth: {
        user: User
    }
}

```

### `vite-env.d.ts`
This file is used to declare environment variables. Create a new file called `vite-env.d.ts` in the root of your project.

```typescript
/// <reference types="vite/client" />
```

## Optional: Tailwind CSS setup
If you want to use Tailwind CSS, you need to install the package and create a configuration file. Below is the steps you need to follow.

### Install the npm package
```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

### Tailwind CSS config
Tailwind will automatically create a `tailwind.config.js` file in the root of your project. Below is the configurations you need.

```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: [
    "./vendor/laravel/framework/src/Illuminate/Pagination/resources/views/*.blade.php",
    "./storage/framework/views/*.php",
    "./resources/views/**/*.blade.php",
    "./resources/js/**/*.tsx",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

### Tailwind Directives
You need to add the Tailwind directives to the `resources/css/app.css` file. Below is the directives you need to add.

```css
@import 'tailwindcss/base';
@import 'tailwindcss/components';
@import 'tailwindcss/utilities';
```

That's it! You now have a base setup for a Laravel, Inertia.js, React and Typescript project. This is a great starting point for a new project, if you don't feel like using Laravel Breeze.
