> Laravel: Pivot Tables

If you have many to many relationships in Laravel, you'll need to create a pivot table. This table will contain the foreign keys of the two tables you're connecting.

Below you can see an example of a pivot table for a many to many relationship between the `emails` and `templates` tables.

```php
Schema::create("email_templates", function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->id();
    $table->foreignId("email_id")->constrained();
    $table->foreignId("template_id")->constrained();
    $table->timestamps();
});
```

In this example, the `email_id` and `template_id` columns are foreign keys that reference the `id` column of the `emails` and `templates` tables, respectively.

When you're working with pivot tables in Laravel, you can access the pivot data using the `pivot` attribute on the relationship.

```php
$email = Email::find(1);
$template = Template::find(1);

$email->templates()->attach($template, ["is_default" => true]);

$defaultTemplate = $email->templates->firstWhere("pivot.is_default", true);
```
