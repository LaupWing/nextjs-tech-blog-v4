> Mysql: Importa Large Database into sql

How to import large database (I've done this with 10gb databases) into sql with just one line of code. This is an even better option than using a software like phpmyadmin or mysql workbench.

```bash
mysql -u username -p database_name < database.sql
```

That's it! You can also use this to export a database.

```bash
mysqldump -u username -p database_name > database.sql
```

Note: the database.sql file must be in the same directory as the command is run. Otherwise you must specify the path to the file.
