> Using Depcheck: Analyzing Dependencies in Your Project

Depcheck is a powerful tool for analyzing dependencies in your Node.js project. It helps you identify unused dependencies and ensures that your project includes only the necessary packages. Here's how you can use Depcheck to streamline your development process.

## Installation

First, you need to install Depcheck globally or locally in your Node.js project:

```bash
npm install -g depcheck
```
or

```bash
npm install --save-dev depcheck
```
## Analyzing Dependencies
Once Depcheck is installed, you can run it from the command line in your project directory:

```bash
depcheck
```

Depcheck will scan your project's files and analyze the dependencies declared in your package.json file. It will then provide a report highlighting any unused dependencies or missing dependencies.

## Example Usage
Suppose you have a Node.js project with unnecessary dependencies or missing ones. Running Depcheck can help you identify and clean up your project's dependencies:

```bash
depcheck
```

The output might look like this:

```bash
Unused dependencies
* lodash

Missing dependencies
* react
* express
```	

## Integrating with Your Workflow
You can integrate Depcheck into your workflow to automatically check dependencies as part of your build process or continuous integration pipeline. For example, you can add a script to your package.json file: 
```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "depcheck": "depcheck"
    }
}
```

Then, you can run Depcheck as part of your build process:

```bash 
npm run depcheck
```

This ensures that your project's dependencies are regularly checked and kept up-to-date.
