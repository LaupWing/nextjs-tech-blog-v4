> React: Arbitrary Variants Tailwind

## Before version 3.1

Ever since version 3.1 of Tailwind CSS, a new syntax allows you to create custom styles directly in your HTML. This feature is particularly useful for styling components in React that you donâ€™t have control over, such as those from third-party npm packages.

Imagine you have a Paragraph component from a React UI library:

```jsx
import Paragraph from "some-react-ui-package"

const HelloWorld = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <Paragraph />
        </div>
    )
}
```

Before the introduction of arbitrary variants in Tailwind, you had to manually grab a specific selector on the element and add it to your CSS file. However, with arbitrary variants, you can now select specific elements using CSS selectors within square brackets.

## After version 3.1

In the example below, the & symbol is used to select the child element (borrowed from SCSS or SASS), and the underscore \_ represents a space. After the underscore, you put the element of choice (in this case, the paragraph element).

Follow that with a colon : and the Tailwind class you want to apply to that CSS selector. That's it for Tailwind arbitrary variants!

```jsx
import Paragraph from "some-react-ui-package"

const HelloWorld = () => {
    return (
        <div className="[&_p]:text-red-400">
            <Paragraph />
        </div>
    )
}
```

In this example, we've selected the paragraph child from the div element and applied the Tailwind class text-red-400 to it.
