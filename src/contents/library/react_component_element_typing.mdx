> React, TypeScript: JSX Element Auto-Completion

Many developers define an interface named `Props` for their React components and consider it sufficient.

```jsx
interface Props {
  children?: React.ReactNode
  some_prop: string
}
```

However, there's a more effective approach! Import ComponentPropsWithoutRef and assign it to the element you want to set props for.

## Code

```jsx
import type { FC, ComponentPropsWithoutRef } from "react"

export const DivContainer: FC<ComponentPropsWithoutRef<"div">> = () => (
    <div></div>
)
```

This method enhances the development experience by letting TypeScript infer and enforce the correct props for the specified HTML element.
