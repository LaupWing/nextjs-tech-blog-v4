> React: New way of handling navigation in Next.js

Starting from version 13 of Next.js, you need to access router information through different hooks. In previous versions, you could manage all your router and navigation functionalities with a single **`useRouter`** hook.

```jsx
import { useRouter } from 'next/router'
```

With this single router hook, you could practically handle anything related to routes, such as redirecting, replacing, and getting query parameters.

But now, you have to pull router information from different hooks to achieve the same functionality. In this blog post, we will go over them.

```jsx
import {
	useRouter,
	usePathname,
	useSearchParams,
	useParams
} from 'next/navigation'
```

## **`useParams`**

The **`useParams`** function in Next.js is a client-side component hook that allows you to access dynamic parameters from the current URL. It returns an object containing the filled-in dynamic parameters, where each property represents a segment from the route with its corresponding value. This enables you to dynamically render components based on the current route's parameters, facilitating flexible and interactive web applications.

**Example**: For instance, if your route is **`/shop/[tag]/[item]`** and your URL is **`/shop/shoes/nike-air-max-97`**, **`useParams`** would return **`{ tag: 'shoes', item: 'nike-air-max-97' }`**.

## **`useRouter`**

A client-side component hook provided by Next.js for programmatically changing routes inside Client Components. Typically, use the **`<Link>`** component for navigation, unless specific requirements dictate using **`useRouter`**.

**Functionality**:

- **`router.push(href: string, { scroll: boolean })`**: Performs client-side navigation to the provided route, adding a new entry into the browser’s history stack.
- **`router.replace(href: string, { scroll: boolean })`**: Performs client-side navigation to the provided route without adding a new entry into the browser’s history stack.
- **`router.refresh()`**: Refreshes the current route, making a new request to the server, re-fetching data requests, and re-rendering Server Components.
- **`router.prefetch(href: string)`**: Prefetches the provided route for faster client-side transitions.
- **`router.back()`**: Navigates back to the previous route in the browser’s history stack.
- **`router.forward()`**: Navigates forwards to the next page in the browser’s history stack.

## **`useSearchParams`**

**`useSearchParams`** is a client-side component hook in Next.js that enables you to read the current URL's query string parameters. It returns a read-only version of the **`URLSearchParams`** interface, allowing you to access and manipulate the query string.

## **`usePathname`**

**`usePathname`** is a client-side component hook in Next.js that allows you to read the current URL's pathname. It returns a string representing the current pathname, enabling you to dynamically respond to changes in the URL's path within your client-side components. This hook is particularly useful for building interactive web applications where you need to conditionally render components based on the current URL.
