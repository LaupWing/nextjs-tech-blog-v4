> React: How to add tailwind to a React Vite project

The exact steps described here can also be found in the official Tailwind documentation.

The only difference is that we will not use the template flag to generate our React project with Vite.

Instead, we will use the terminal selection to get our React TypeScript boilerplate.

## Create React TypeScript Project with Vite

### Initialize

Run the following script and choose the options to create a boilerplate Vite React TypeScript project:

```bash
npm create vite@latest

```

First, you will have to define a name for the project.

I have named mine vite-react-typescript, but you are free to name your project however you like.

Next, choose the React framework.

Next to that, you will need to select the TypeScript option if you want to add TypeScript to it.

    height={200}
/>

### Change Directory and Install

Now that we have the boilerplate setup, we can change the directory into that project and install the npm packages:

```bash
cd vite-react-typescript
npm install
```

## Installing tailwind

Next, we'll install Tailwind.

### **Install Tailwind CSS**

First, install **`tailwindcss`** and its peer dependencies. After that, it will generate your **`tailwind.config.js`** and **`postcss.config.js`** files.

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p

```

### **Configure Your Template Paths**

Update your **`tailwind.config.js`** file to include the paths to all your template files.

```jsx
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}

```

### **Add the Tailwind Directives to Your CSS**

In your **`./src/index.css`** file, add the **`@tailwind`** directives for each of Tailwind's layers.
