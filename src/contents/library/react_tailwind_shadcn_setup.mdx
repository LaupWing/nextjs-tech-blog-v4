> React: How to add shadcn to a NextJS project

The exact steps described here can also be found in the official Shadcn documentation.

## Create Nextjs TypeScript Project with your terminal

### Initialize

Open up your terminal.

Run the following script, the following script will create a boilerplate Nextjs TypeScript project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app --typescript --tailwind

```

Of course, you can name your project whatever you like.

To do this, you will have to replace `my-app` with the name you want to give your project.

### Change Directory

Now that we have the boilerplate setup, we can change the directory into that project:

```bash
cd my-app
```

## Installing Shadcn

Next, we'll install Shadcn.

### **Install Shadcn**

The following command will open up a dialog box that will guide you through the installation process:

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest init
```

You will be asked a series of questions:
* Which style would you like to use?
  * This doesn't matter, you can choose any style you like. You can change this later if you would like to.
* Which color would you like to use as base color?
  * Also this doesn't matter, you can choose any color you like. You can change this later if you would like to.
* Do you want to use CSS variables for colors?
  * Just type `yes` or `no` depending on your preference. But I would recommend you to use CSS variables for colors. It is easier to manage.

```bash
Which style would you like to use? › Default
Which color would you like to use as base color? › Slate
Do you want to use CSS variables for colors? › no / yes
```

### **Custom fonts (Optional)**

This is optional, but if you would like to use custom fonts, here are the two steps you need to follow:

#### **Step 1: Add the font to your root**
Go to the root layout of your project and add the following line of code:


```jsx
import "@/styles/globals.css"
import { Inter as FontSans } from "next/font/google"

import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"

const fontSans = FontSans({
  subsets: ["latin"],
  variable: "--font-sans",
})

export default function RootLayout({ children }: RootLayoutProps) {
  return (
    <html lang="en" suppressHydrationWarning>
      <head />
      <body
        className={cn(
          "min-h-screen bg-background font-sans antialiased",
          fontSans.variable
        )}
      >
        ...
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

#### **Step 2: Add the font to your tailwind config**
Now you need to add the font to your tailwind config file. Open up your `tailwind.config.js` file and add the following line of code:

```js
const { fontFamily } = require("tailwindcss/defaultTheme")

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  darkMode: ["class"],
  content: ["app/**/*.{ts,tsx}", "components/**/*.{ts,tsx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      fontFamily: {
        sans: ["var(--font-sans)", ...fontFamily.sans],
      },
    },
  },
}
```   

### **That’s it!**

Thats it! You have successfully added Shadcn to your Nextjs project.

You probably have noticed that there a couple of directories added to your project. These directories are added by Shadcn and are used to manage the components of your project.

* `components/ui`: Here you will find all the components that are used or added to your project.
* `lib/utils.ts`: This file contains a utility function that is used to combine classnames.

If you would like to add a new component to your project, you can go to this url: [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/accordion) and copy the code of the component you would like to add to your project.
