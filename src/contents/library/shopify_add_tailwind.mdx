> Shopify: How to add tailwind to shopify theme development

In this short article, I will show you how you can easily add Tailwind to your Shopify theme deveopment pipeline, so that you can use Tailwind for every custom Shopify theme development project.

## **Create project**

First, create a directory where you want to place your project files.

Then, **`cd`** into that project.

```bash
mkdir project
cd project
```

Now, create a folder called **`theme`**. This is the directory where you'll hold all your theme-specific files. You can either create your theme files manually or create them with the Shopify CLI command by pulling or creating a boilerplate. I won’t go into this step because I want to primarily focus on how to add Tailwind to a Shopify project.

Now let's move on to the steps for setting up Tailwind.

## **package.json**

We need to initialize this project with npm by using the **`npm init`** command in the root directory.

```bash
npm init --y
```

We have added the **`--y`** flag to set all the package JSON info as the default.

Now, we can get into the steps for initializing Tailwind.

## **Adding Tailwind**

Here is a brief overview of how to add Tailwind to this project.

### **Install Tailwind CSS**

Use npm to install Tailwind and initialize the Tailwind configuration file.

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init
```

The command will create a file called **`tailwind.config.js`**.

## **Configure template paths**

Now, we need to tell Tailwind which files to check for Tailwind classes. Since we are building a Shopify theme with Liquid files, we need to specify the location of the Liquid files. In our case, the actual Shopify theme project lives in the **`theme`** folder. So, we need to correctly specify it here.

```jsx
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
    content: ["./theme/**/*.liquid"],
    theme: {
        extend: {},
    },
}
```

It basically watches for every Liquid file within the theme directory.

## **Creating CSS file and adding the directives**

Within the root directory, create an **`index.css`** file.

Inside this file, we will simply add the Tailwind directives.

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

## **Tailwind command**

Now, we need to add an npm command within our **`package.json`** file to run the Tailwind compiler.

```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "tw": "npx tailwindcss -i ./style.css -o ./theme/assets/style.css --watch"
    },
    "devDependencies": {
        "tailwindcss": "^3.4.1"
    }
}
```

Notice that the output file will be generated within the **`assets`** directory that is within the theme directory.

## **Adding `style.css` to Shopify theme**

Now, we only need to include the generated **`style.css`** into our Shopify project.

To do this, you need to put the **`{{ "style.css" | asset_url | stylesheet_tag }}`** liquid code snippet inside the layout of your theme (**`layout > theme.liquid`**).

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="{{ request.locale.iso_code }}">

<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1">
    <meta name="theme-color" content="">
    <title>
        {{ page_title }}
    </title>
    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com" />
    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" />
    {{ "style.css" | asset_url | stylesheet_tag }}
    <link
        href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Bebas+Neue&family=Montserrat:ital,wght@0,100..900;1,100..900&display=swap"
        rel="stylesheet" />
    {{ content_for_header }}
</head>

<body class="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center">
    {% render "announcement" %}
    {% render "header" %}

    {{ content_for_layout }}
    {% render "footer" %}
</body>

</html>
```

That’s it!

Now you can use your favorite CSS library with every Shopify project you are going to build.
