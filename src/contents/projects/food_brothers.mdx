What if ordering a premium burger was as satisfying as eating one? That was the challenge behind Food Brothers — building a digital experience that matches the quality of an upscale Amsterdam burger restaurant.

The result? A production-ready ordering platform that turns hungry visitors into paying customers in under 60 seconds.

> ## The Challenge

Restaurant owners face a tough choice: rely on third-party delivery apps that take 15-30% of every order, or build a custom solution that costs tens of thousands of euros. Food Brothers proves there's a better way — a white-label ordering system that puts restaurants back in control of their customer relationships and profit margins.

> ## Built for Conversion

Every pixel serves a purpose. The hero section immediately establishes trust with integrated Google Reviews (4.8 stars from 1,500+ customers). Below, signature burgers with one-tap ordering reduce friction to almost zero. The floating cart stays visible throughout, gently reminding users of their growing order while never blocking the menu.

The numbers speak for themselves:

| Metric | Score |
|--------|:-----:|
| Performance | **95** |
| Accessibility | **96** |
| Best Practices | **96** |
| SEO | **100** |

These aren't vanity metrics — they translate directly to faster page loads, better search rankings, and more completed orders.

> ## The Menu Experience

Managing 50+ menu items across 13 categories could easily become overwhelming. Instead, users get a clean, scrollable interface with real-time search that filters results as they type. Category tabs glide smoothly across the screen, making it feel less like browsing a database and more like flipping through a well-designed menu.

Premium burgers deserve premium customization. The product modal lets customers build their perfect burger with 11+ toppings — from classic additions to premium options like truffle mayo and halal veal bacon. Prices update in real-time as selections change, eliminating checkout surprises that kill conversions.

Dietary icons (halal, gluten, egg) appear throughout, because inclusivity isn't optional when you're serving a diverse Amsterdam customer base.

> ## Frictionless Checkout

The checkout flow handles the complexity that kills conversions elsewhere. Delivery or pickup? One toggle. Dutch address entry with smart validation? Built in. Preferred delivery time, discount codes, special instructions — all captured without overwhelming the customer.

The order summary displays every item with its customizations, so customers know exactly what they're getting before they commit. No surprises, no abandoned carts.

> ## Mobile-First, Desktop-Perfect

70% of food orders happen on mobile devices. Food Brothers was designed phone-first, then scaled up — not retrofitted. Touch targets are generous, scrolling is buttery smooth, and the floating cart button stays accessible without blocking content.

On desktop, the experience transforms into a spacious layout with a persistent sidebar cart, perfect for office lunch orders or family meal planning.

> ## Speaking Their Language

Amsterdam is international. Food Brothers serves both Dutch locals and English-speaking visitors with instant language switching — no page reload, no lost cart items. It's a small detail that makes a big difference in a city where tourists and expats are paying customers too.

> ## Accessible to Everyone

WCAG 2.1 compliance isn't a checkbox feature — it's 15% of your potential customers. Full keyboard navigation, screen reader support, AA-compliant contrast ratios, and clear focus indicators mean everyone can place an order, regardless of how they interact with the web.

> ## Ready for Launch

This isn't a prototype. Food Brothers is a complete, production-ready platform. Connect a payment gateway (Stripe, Mollie, or iDEAL), configure your domain, and you're taking real orders.

What's included:
- Complete ordering flow from browse to checkout
- Cart persistence across sessions
- Multi-language support (NL/EN)
- Mobile-optimized responsive design
- Accessibility compliance
- SEO optimization

What you'd add for production:
- Payment gateway integration
- Order notification system (email/SMS)
- Optional: Kitchen display integration

> ## The Bigger Picture

Food Brothers represents a shift in how restaurants can approach digital ordering. Instead of surrendering margins to delivery platforms or investing in expensive custom development, restaurants can deploy a polished, conversion-optimized ordering system that they actually own.

For me, this project was a masterclass in e-commerce UX — understanding that every animation, every button placement, every micro-interaction either moves customers toward checkout or pushes them away. The technical stack (Next.js 16, React 19, Zustand, Radix UI) made it possible to iterate quickly and ship a product that performs as good as it looks.
