Food Brothers is a complete restaurant ordering solution designed for an upscale burger establishment in Amsterdam. The website features a premium aesthetic with smooth animations, intuitive navigation, and a seamless ordering flow that takes customers from menu browsing to checkout in just a few taps.

> ## Lighthouse Performance

The website achieves near-perfect Lighthouse scores across all metrics:

| Metric | Score |
|--------|:-----:|
| Performance | **95** |
| Accessibility | **96** |
| Best Practices | **96** |
| SEO | **100** |

> ## Project Overview

This website is **100% functional** and production-ready. The only missing component is payment gateway integration (Stripe, Mollie, or iDEAL). Once connected, this becomes a fully operational ordering system capable of handling real customer orders.

> ## Responsive Design

The website follows a mobile-first approach:

- **Mobile** - Optimized for smartphone ordering with touch-friendly controls
- **Tablet** - Beautiful layouts for iPad and Android tablets
- **Desktop** - Full-width layout with sidebar cart preview

> ## Accessibility (WCAG 2.1)

Built with accessibility in mind:

- **ARIA Labels** - Screen reader support for all interactive elements
- **Keyboard Navigation** - Full keyboard accessibility throughout
- **Color Contrast** - AA compliant color ratios
- **Focus Indicators** - Clear focus states for all controls

> ## What's Needed to Go Live

This project is deployment-ready. To make it fully operational:

1. **Payment Gateway Integration** - Stripe, Mollie, or iDEAL with webhook handlers
2. **Backend API** (Optional) - Order management, email notifications, kitchen display
3. **Custom Domain** - Already deployed on Vercel, just needs domain configuration

> ## Lessons Learned

- **State Management Simplicity** - Zustand proved to be the perfect choice for e-commerce state. Its simplicity over Redux made cart logic straightforward to implement and debug.

- **Mobile-First Pays Off** - Starting with mobile design and scaling up resulted in a much cleaner codebase than retrofitting responsive design later.

- **Radix UI for Accessibility** - Using Radix primitives for modals, dropdowns, and sheets meant accessibility came almost for free, significantly reducing development time on a11y features.

- **Form Validation UX** - Combining React Hook Form with Zod schemas creates an excellent developer and user experience. Real-time validation feedback keeps users informed without being intrusive.
