Selling eyeglasses online is harder than it looks. Customers can't try frames on. They can't feel the weight. They can't see if the color matches their skin tone. Most eyewear stores throw products on a generic Shopify theme and wonder why conversion rates stay flat.

Franks Optiek is different. It's a custom theme built specifically for premium optical retailers — designed to make customers *feel* the quality before they click "Buy."

> ## The Problem Premium Retailers Face

Walk into a high-end optical store and you'll notice something: the experience sells as much as the product. Careful lighting on the frames. Knowledgeable staff who remember your preferences. A curated selection that doesn't overwhelm.

Online, most eyewear stores lose all of that. Generic themes. Cluttered product pages. Filters that don't understand the difference between "Havana brown" and "Tortoise shell." Customers who need progressive lenses mixed with customers who want fashion sunglasses.

Franks Optiek recreates the boutique experience online:

- **Visual merchandising** that showcases frame details and colors
- **Advanced filtering** that speaks the language of eyewear
- **Trust signals** that justify premium pricing
- **Mobile-first design** for customers browsing on the go

> ## Built for Conversion

Every element is designed to move customers toward purchase:

**Hero Slideshow** — Auto-rotating slides with scroll-snap navigation. Showcase new collections, seasonal promotions, or featured brands without overwhelming the page.

**Brand Marquee** — An infinite-scrolling logo strip featuring Ray-Ban, Oakley, Gucci, Prada, and other premium brands. Builds trust instantly. "If they carry *these* brands, they're serious."

**Category Grid** — Circular image cards that guide customers to exactly what they're looking for. Prescription glasses. Sunglasses. Kids frames. No hunting through menus.

**Featured Collections** — Tab-switching interface that lets customers browse bestsellers, new arrivals, and sale items without page loads.

> ## Filtering That Actually Works

The collection page is where generic themes fail eyewear stores. Franks Optiek gets it right:

**Price Range Slider** — Min/max filtering with visual feedback. Customers set their budget once and browse freely.

**Brand Filtering** — Multi-select vendor filtering for customers loyal to specific brands.

**Attribute Filtering** — Frame shape, material, size, gender — whatever product attributes matter to your inventory.

**Active Filter Pills** — One-click removal of any filter. No "Reset All" or "Start Over" — just tap the filter you want to remove.

**Smart Sorting** — Price (low/high), newest first, bestselling, alphabetical. Whatever customers expect.

On mobile, the sidebar transforms into a slide-out drawer. Full filtering power in a thumb-friendly interface.

> ## Product Pages That Sell

The product page is where decisions happen. Franks Optiek maximizes every pixel:

**Multi-Image Gallery** — Thumbnail navigation for browsing angles. Front, side, folded, on-model. Customers see exactly what they're buying.

**Color Swatches** — Visual selection with gradient support for multi-tone frames. "Havana brown" shows as actual havana brown, not just text.

**Variant Selection** — Size, color, lens type — clean dropdowns and swatches that don't clutter the page.

**Breadcrumb Navigation** — Customers always know where they are: Home > Sunglasses > Ray-Ban > Aviator Classic.

**Related Products** — "You might also like" recommendations keep customers browsing. Cross-selling without being pushy.

> ## What I Learned

Building Franks Optiek reinforced something I already knew: e-commerce details matter more than features.

The color swatch system took three iterations. First version: simple colored circles. Customers didn't recognize "Havana brown." Second version: text labels. Too cluttered. Final version: gradients for multi-tone frames with Dutch color name mapping. A small detail that makes variant selection actually *work*.

The filter drawer on mobile went through similar evolution. First attempt: accordion-style collapsible sections. Too many taps. Second attempt: all filters visible. Too much scrolling. Final version: smart defaults with expandable sections. Most customers filter by price and brand — those are always visible. Everything else is one tap away.

Premium retail is about removing friction. Every tap, every scroll, every moment of confusion is a potential lost sale. Franks Optiek removes friction at every step.
