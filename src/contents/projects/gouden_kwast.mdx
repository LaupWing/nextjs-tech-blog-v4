I've created a website for a local painting company owned by a friend. To view the website, click on this [link](https://gatsby.loc-nguyen.com/) or use the link provided in the website header.

> ## **Technologies Used**

For this project, I employed the following technologies:

-   **WordPress**: I chose WordPress as the content management system (CMS) to empower my friend to add and edit posts easily. WordPress is widely used, making it simple to debug and more user-friendly.
-   **Gatsby**: To enable WordPress as a headless CMS, I used Gatsby, a React-based framework with excellent tools for seamless integration. Keep in mind that this information is accurate as of 2020, and popularity trends may have shifted since then.
-   **Tailwind**: Utilized as the CSS framework, Tailwind proves to be an excellent choice for streamlined styling.

> ## **Brief Overview of the Website**

The website primarily serves as a platform to showcase the services of the painting company to potential clients. All the displayed items are dynamically generated by fetching data from WordPress.

If you utilize the contact form, the submitted data will be posted to the WordPress database linked to this website.
